The relationship between physical materials and digital expression has always fascinated me. How do we translate the texture of paper, the weight of ink, or the depth of paint into pixels and screens?

My work often bridges these two worlds, drawing inspiration from traditional art forms while embracing the possibilities of digital tools. There's something beautiful about maintaining that connection to materiality, even in the most abstract digital spaces.

This exploration of materiality in digital design helps create more meaningful, grounded experiences that feel both modern and timeless.
