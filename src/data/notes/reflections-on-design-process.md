I used to love blogging in my journals on the internet, but somewhere along the way, I watched myself and everyone move from blogging to sharing our updates on our stories and posts.

There's something I miss about longer-form writing without the commercialization of it - the pressure of turning every poignant, entertaining, wise thought into "content creation." I fell into that trap, thinking that's something I wanted to make, until one day, I realized that thoughts can just be thoughts without any pressure to monetize from them.

I suppose my attempt at writing this here is my attempt to share notes without the need to get any external validation. This is an exercise to expression, without a need for a response, a like, a comment.
